  {
    question: "Do I need a gym membership?",
    answer: "Not necessarily! While having access to a gym gives you more equipment options, I create programs for both gym and home workouts. For home training, you'll need some basic equipment like dumbbells, resistance bands, and a stability ball, but we can work with whatever you have available."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this beginner friendly?",
    answer: "Absolutely! My programs are designed for all fitness levels, from complete beginners to experienced lifters. If you're new to strength training, I'll focus on building proper form and gradually increasing intensity as you progress."
  },
  {
    question: "How much time do I need to commit each week?",
    answer: "My programs typically recommend 3-4 training sessions per week, each lasting 45-60 minutes. However, I believe in quality over quantity and will work with your schedule to create a realistic plan that fits your life."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide meal plans?",
    answer: "Rather than rigid meal plans that are hard to follow long-term, I focus on sustainable nutrition habits and provide flexible meal templates, recipe ideas, and guidance on portion sizes. This approach helps you develop a healthy relationship with food while supporting your fitness goals."
  },
  {
    question: "How long until I see results?",
    answer: "Most clients notice improvements in energy and strength within 2-3 weeks. Physical changes typically become more noticeable around 6-8 weeks of consistent training. Remember that sustainable results take time, but they're also the ones that last!"
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your approach different from other trainers?",
    answer: "I focus on the whole person, not just workouts. My coaching addresses mindset, habits, and lifestyle factors alongside effective training. I believe in building a sustainable approach that works with your life, rather than forcing you to completely restructure around a rigid program."
